Title: Responding to Fainting
Text: If someone faints, gently guide them to lie down on a safe surface. Elevate their legs slightly if possible. Monitor breathing and consciousness. Keep the person calm and remain with them until they are fully alert.

Title: Ensuring Safety
Text: Remove nearby objects that could cause injury. Loosen tight clothing to allow comfort. Do not attempt to force them to stand before they are fully alert. Encourage slow, calm breathing once responsive.
