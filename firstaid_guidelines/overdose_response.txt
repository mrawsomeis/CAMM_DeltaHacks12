Title: Responding to Suspected Overdose
Text: If someone appears unresponsive or intoxicated, do not attempt to administer medication. Ensure the person is in a safe position on their side if they are breathing. Monitor breathing and consciousness continuously. Keep them warm and calm. Stay with them until community help arrives.

Title: Monitoring Safety
Text: Remove any objects that could cause injury. Avoid shaking or restraining the person. Speak calmly and gently, encouraging minimal movement. Only provide support that keeps them safe and comfortable.

Title: Observing for Changes
Text: Watch for changes in breathing, color, or consciousness. If they become responsive, encourage slow breathing and calm communication. Do not make assumptions about what substance may have been taken. Focus solely on safety and supportive presence.
