Title: Responding to a Seizure
Text: If someone is having a seizure, protect them from nearby hazards and objects. Cushion their head if possible. Do not restrain their movements. Allow the seizure to pass naturally while monitoring breathing.

Title: After the Seizure
Text: Once the seizure ends, gently place the person on their side in a safe position. Keep them calm and remain nearby. Avoid giving food or drink immediately. Focus solely on safety and comfort.
