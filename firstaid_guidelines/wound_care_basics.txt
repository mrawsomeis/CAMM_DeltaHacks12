Title: Basic Wound Care
Text: For minor cuts or scrapes, wash hands first. Clean the wound with safe water, apply an antiseptic if available, and cover with a clean dressing. Monitor for signs of infection.

Title: Handling Bleeding
Text: Apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or bandage. Elevate the affected area if possible. Seek trained help if bleeding continues or is severe.
